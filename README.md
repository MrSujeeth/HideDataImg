**🖼️ Cryptic Canvas – Image Steganography Tool**
Cryptic Canvas is a Python-based GUI application that allows users to hide secret text messages inside images and retrieve them later using LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography.
The tool provides a simple and user-friendly interface built with Tkinter.

🔐 What is Steganography?

Steganography is the technique of hiding information inside digital media such as images, audio, or video files in a way that is invisible to the human eye.
Cryptic Canvas uses LSB Image Steganography, where message bits are hidden in the least significant bits of image pixels.
